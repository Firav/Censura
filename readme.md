# ⳺ Censura ⳻
Advanced censorship plugin for minecraft servers

Censura's goal is to completely eliminate usage of selected words on your minecraft server.

Filters include using game chat, placing and editing signs, editing and signing books, renaming items on an anvil and
filtering arguments of selected commands.

You can add any words to the 3-step filter via configuration file. You can also add exceptions for each word to avoid
false positives. Any detection will result in action triggering it to be cancelled - chat message won't send, sign will
be placed empty etc. In addition you can set any commands to trigger on detection to punish the player.

See [plugin wiki](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/Censura/wiki) for more details.
