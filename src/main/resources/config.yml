##### FILTERS
# Filters are processed in order from top to bottom
# You can have an unlimited number of filters.
###############################################################
# Each filter has a list of "matches". These are words that are checked for the filter.
# Types of matches:
#   - "fullword" Checks if the sentence contains this word. It must be surrounded by spaces.
#                Besides that, the filter is smart and will ignore any characters in between the word.
#                You can use the * character to bypass the limitation of needing a space: "test*" will match on "testsomething"
#   - "contain"  Checks if the sentence contains the string, the string may be part of another word.
#                Will ignore spaces inside the word unless they're used in an obviously spammy way.
#   - "regex"    Match a simple regex on the string. No smartness involved.
# By default the "fullword" match type is used.

###############################################################
# Each filter can have an unlimited number of "actions". Possible "action" types:
#   - "message: <message>" - sends a message to player who triggered the filter
#   - "command: <command>" - executes command as console.
# Placeholders available for all actions:
# %player% - name of the player who triggered the filter
